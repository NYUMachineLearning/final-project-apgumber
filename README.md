# final-project-apgumber
final-project-apgumber created by GitHub Classroom

This is my final project submission. I created 3 different Rmd files. The first, named Gumber_final 
contains my data cleaning steps, variable distributions, and feature selection. 
The second file, Gumber_unsupervised contains my unsupervised learning methods, and the third, 
Gumber_supervised_models contains all the classification models that I performed.
Also submitted html versions as well.
